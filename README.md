> Watch movies & listen to music — together, in sync.

## 🚀 Project Overview

SyncPlay is a real-time social platform that allows users to watch movies and listen to music together in perfectly synchronized virtual rooms.

The core philosophy of SyncPlay is:

- Zero friction entry (guest-first experience)
- Shared media experiences
- Cinema-grade movie rooms
- Spotify-like music rooms
- Real-time chat, voice, and reactions
- Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)

Users can instantly create or join rooms, invite friends via a shareable link, and enjoy media together as if they were in the same physical space.
